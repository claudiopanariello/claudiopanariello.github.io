22 solenoids, 2 microcontrollers, cables, laptop.

This is a site-specific interactive sound installation inspired by the architecture of the porch inside the garden of the Goethe Institut in Rome. The aim of the work is to make this space musical creating a sort of sound path that is sensitive to the spectatorâ€™s presence with which it tries to dialogue and at the same time suggesting a new acoustic interpretation of the chosen space.

Watch a [**video presentation**][video] of the installation or read on [**LMJ**][art] about it.
